# CS-210-Project-Three

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this Project, we were tasked to build a item-tracking program for a company named Corner Grocer. This program is made to track the items inside of a txt file, and then
create a record file that lists all the items that are purchased often inside the txt file.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did particially well when it comes to creating a switch for the user to choose between 1-4 in the menu. Due to the previous assignments teaching us about swtiches, I decided to use this knowledge to create a switch that finds the food inputed, produces it's value, and then translates it to histogram.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I wish I could enhance the switch options for the user whenever they make the wrong input for the options. For now it just repeats the phrase "Wrong option, please try again!" whenever the user inputs the wrong option, and it's like this because I made the option default. I would remove this default option since even with break, it still repeats. Rather, I would create an if statement that processes if the user made a wrong input, and if they did it resets for the user to pick another option. The code could be enchanced without this default spam message, making the process of trial and error smoother for the program.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of code I had the most difficulty on is making a code that reads the "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt" file and redistributes it inside of frequency.dat.
Thankfully, after looking back on how I used a code similarity to a assignment (reading a file and input it inside of another), I finally understood what must be done to complete
this section of the program. W3Schools is a valuable resource I used to code in a method of reading the file and distributing it inside frequency.dat.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I sttrongly believe my skill in developing menus and transferring files can be used for future projects and course work. It seems as though switches are heavily used to make a 
controlled, and precise options menu for the user to use. It would make sense for future assignments to utilize this statement as a better way of formatting.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making it as simple as possible. What I mean by this is that I coded the program with essentials that it needed: classes, a switch system, a menu class, and a way for files to be read/written. Once I thought about the essentials, coding it together made things understandable for me, and whenever I made a mistake I
can simply go back to edit it withhout breaking the structure.
